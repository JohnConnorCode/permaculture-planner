# Permaculture Planner - Raised Bed Garden Design App

A Next.js 14 application that generates AI-powered permaculture plans for raised-bed gardens on any surface (soil, gravel, concrete, or rooftops). Based on research-backed horticulture principles from agricultural extension services.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented (v1)
- **Smart Layout Generation**: Optimized bed placement based on space, sun exposure, and accessibility
- **Materials Calculator**: Complete bill of materials with cost estimates
- **Crop Rotation Engine**: Science-based 3-season rotation preventing disease and maximizing yields
- **Plan Builder Wizard**: Step-by-step guidance through site assessment
- **Irrigation Planning**: Drip system layouts and wicking bed designs
- **Task Scheduling**: Monthly garden tasks and planting calendar
- **Multiple Surface Support**: Works on soil, concrete, patios, and rooftops
- **Horticulture Rules Engine**: Based on extension service research

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Visual layout editor with drag-and-drop beds
- AI copilot for personalized advice
- PDF export and sharing

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/permaculture-planner.git
cd permaculture-planner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

4. Set up the database:

Run the SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/` in your Supabase SQL editor.

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## Core Algorithms

### Layout Generator
Generates optimal raised bed layouts based on:
- Available space and shape
- Sun exposure requirements (6+ hours for most vegetables)
- North-south orientation for even lighting
- Accessibility needs (3ft vs 4ft bed widths)
- Path widths (18-36 inches)

### Materials Calculator
Calculates exact quantities for:
- Soil mix (cu ft/yards)
- Compost and amendments
- Lumber (optimized cut list)
- Hardware and irrigation supplies
- Row covers and support structures

### Crop Rotation Engine
Implements science-based rotation:
- Prevents same-family plantings for 2-3 years
- Matches crops to sun exposure
- Succession planting for continuous harvest
- Companion planting recommendations

## Horticulture Rules

The app implements research-backed guidelines from:
- USDA hardiness zones and frost dates
- Extension service recommendations for bed dimensions
- IPM (Integrated Pest Management) principles
- Water-efficient irrigation methods
- Soil building techniques (sheet mulching)

## Database Schema

Key tables:
- `sites`: User garden locations and constraints
- `plans`: Generated garden plans
- `beds`: Individual raised beds with dimensions
- `plantings`: Crop assignments by season
- `materials_estimates`: Shopping lists and costs
- `tasks`: Scheduled garden activities

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/plans` - Generate a new plan from wizard data
- `GET /api/plans/:id` - Retrieve plan details
- `PATCH /api/plans/:id` - Update plan
- `POST /api/plans/:id/ai` - AI copilot queries
