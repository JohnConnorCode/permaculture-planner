### 9. 3D Visualization Mode
**Priority: LOW**
- **Elevation View**
  - Switch between 2D/3D views
  - Terrain elevation mapping

  - Structure height visualization
  - Walk-through mode

## Phase 4: Collaboration & Data (Week 7-8)

### 10. Harvest & Yield Tracking
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Production Analytics**
  - Expected vs actual yield tracking
  - Cost/benefit analysis
  - Labor time tracking
  - Pest and disease notes
  - Photo journal integration

### 11. Community Features
**Priority: LOW**
- **Social Garden Planning**
  - Share designs publicly
  - Fork and remix gardens
  - Local climate zone matching
  - Success story showcase
  - Tips and tricks from design

### 12. AI-Powered Suggestions
**Priority: LOW**
- **Smart Recommendations**
  - Auto-layout optimization
  - Plant selection based on goals
  - Pest management suggestions
  - Seasonal task reminders
  - Yield maximization tips

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Impact (Do First)
1. **Plant Library with Drag-Drop** - Core functionality
2. **Enhanced Visual Rendering** - Immediate visual improvement
3. **Measurement Tools** - Essential for real planning

### High Value (Do Second)
4. **Sun/Shade Analysis** - Critical for plant success
5. **Companion Planting** - Permaculture core principle
6. **Version Control** - User iteration capability

### Nice to Have (Do Later)
7. **3D View** - Impressive but not essential
8. **AI Suggestions** - Advanced feature
9. **Community Features** - Scale consideration

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Use WebGL for complex rendering
- Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for large gardens
- Lazy load plant images and data
- Cache rendered tiles for pan/zoom
- Use Web Workers for analysis calculations

### Data Structure Enhancements
```typescript
interface Plant {
  id: string
  commonName: string
  scientificName: string
  category: PlantCategory
  visualData: {
    icon: string
    sprite: string
    matureSize: { width: number; height: number }
    seasonalColors: Record<Season, string>
  }
  requirements: {
    sun: 'full' | 'partial' | 'shade'
    water: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
    soil: SoilRequirements
    hardiness: { min: number; max: number }
  }
  companions: {
    beneficial: string[]
    antagonistic: string[]
  }
  timeline: {
    plantingWindow: DateRange
    daysToMaturity: number
    harvestWindow: DateRange
  }
}

interface GardenAnalysis {
  sunExposure: HeatMap
  waterRequirements: HeatMap
  companionships: RelationshipGraph
  seasonalView: SeasonalData
  yieldEstimates: YieldProjection
}
```

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Right Panel**: Plant library, searchable and filterable
- **Left Panel**: Tools and drawing options
- **Bottom Panel**: Timeline and seasonal view
- **Top Bar**: View modes, analysis toggles
- **Context Menus**: Right-click for quick actions
- **Tooltips**: Hover for plant info, measurements
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Pro user efficiency

## Success Metrics
- User can plan a complete garden in < 30 minutes
- Visual quality comparable to paid tools
- Performance: 60fps pan/zoom with 100+ plants
- Mobile responsive for on-site planning
- Export quality suitable for printing

## Next Steps
1. Start with Plant Library implementation
2. Add visual textures and rendering improvements
3. Implement measurement and dimension tools
4. Build sun/shade analysis layer
5. Add companion planting visualization

This plan ensures the visual editor becomes a powerful, professional tool while maintaining ease of use for beginners and depth for experienced gardeners.
