## 🎯 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Create multiple garden beds
- [ ] Add plants from all categories
- [ ] Test grouping/ungrouping
- [ ] Verify water calculations
- [ ] Check sun compatibility
- [ ] Test succession planting
- [ ] Verify rotation plans
- [ ] Test all element types
